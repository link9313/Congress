<ul><h3>Women’s Rights</h3>
<li><b>Equal Pay for Equal Work:</b> Addresses discriminatory salary differences that exist between certain groups. 
The Fair Pay Act of 1999 would provide equal wages and benefits for work of equivalent value. 
<!-- (msp_sys.com/en/legis.htm -->
<li><b>‘Glass Ceiling’:</b> Term was popularized in a 1986 Wall Street Journal article describing the invisible barriers (usually prejudice) that women and minorities face as they move up the corporate hierarchy. 
<!-- (ues.about.com/newsissues/womenissues/gi/dynamic/offsite.htm -->
<li><b>Domestic Violence:</b> At the heart of the Domestic Violence Act of 1995 is the protection order. 
It names the person who is abusive and states what behavior is illegal under the order.  The Family Law Act 1996 provides for a single set of civil remedies to deal with domestic violence.  
<!-- (feminist.org and aucklandcitypolice.gov.nz/crime-Prevention/DomesticViolence  -->
 
</ul>
<ul><h3>Minority Rights</h3>
<li><b>Hate Crimes:</b> Congress defines as a crime in which the defendant intentionally selects a victim because of the actual or perceived race, color, national origin, ethnicity, gender, disability or sexual orientation of that person. 
<!-- (Section 280003(a) of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994)(U.S.C. 994 Note) (racerelations.about.com/newsissues/racerelations/library/weekly/aa0425.htm) -->
<li><b>Affirmative Action:</b> Minority applicants are preferentially hired to make up for past discrimination.
The equivalent negative term is ‘Reverse Discrimination’.
Candidates discuss whether ‘preference’ implies a fixed ‘quota’.
<li><b>Racial Profiling:</b> Also known as ‘Driving While Black’.  
Law enforcement practice of using race to decide which motorists to stop.
<li><b>Redlining:</b> Practice where banks draw lines around certain low income and minority neighborhoods. 
The banks then refuse to lend to those neighborhoods. 
<li><b>Bilingual education:</b> Government requirement that U.S. public schools teach children in their native languages.  
Since 1974, all schools that accept federal funding must provide special language programs.   
<!-- Pbs.org/newshour -->
</ul>
 
<ul><h3>Disabled Rights</h3>
<li>Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) & Handicapped Access (see <a href='Background_Health_Care.htm'>Health Care</a>)
<li>Mental Illness Discrimination (see <a href='Background_Health_Care.htm'>Health Care</a>)
</ul>
<ul><h3>Religious Rights</h3>
<li>School Prayer (see <a href='Background_Education.htm'>Education</a>)
<li>Posting Ten Commandments in public places (see <a href='Background_Principles_&_Values.htm'>Principles & Values</a>)
</ul>

<ul><h3>The PATRIOT Act</h3>
<li>The PATRIOT Act is a new topic in our <a href='http://quiz.OnTheIssues.org'>VoteMatch quiz</a> for the 2008 election. It encompasses an enormous number of controversial civil rights issues, from habeas corpus restrictions through the right to privacy. Defense-related aspects of the PATRIOT Act are covered under outr <a href='Homeland_Security.htm'>Homeland Security</a> section.  
<li><b>The USA PATRIOT Act</b> was first passed in Oct. 2001 as a response to 9/11. It was reauthorized by Congress in 2005. The title is an acronym for ‘Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism.’
<li><b>Habeas corpus</b>: The ‘Writ of habeas corpus’ means all people have the right to not be held indefinitely by a government. The Latin term means ‘you have the body’, i.e., that when the government is holding a person, that person can demand a hearing on why they are being held. Habeas corpus is older than the Constitution -- it was part of English Common Law back to the 12th century, and forms a key basis of the legal underpinning of the US Constitution. Critics of the PATRIOT Act claim that Pres. Bush has suspended habeas corpus illegally (by holding prisoners in Guantanamo, e.g.); the Consitution specifies that habeas can only be suspended for civil war or insurrection. 
<li><b>FISA</b>: The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 set up a system of ‘FISA Courts’ which would decide when it was ok for the federal government to spy on people -- by granting surveillance warrants against suspected foreign intelligence agents inside the US. Opponents claim that the FISA courts are sufficient safeguards and that Pres. Bush is conducting ‘warrantless surveillance’ by avoiding FISA. 
<li><b>Secret wiretapping</b>: The Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 established restrictions on unauthorized government access to private electronic communications, such as email or phone calls. The PATRIOT Act weakened those restrictions, which opponents say allows the government to secretly record email and phone conversations by US citizens. An additional controversy comes from requiring electronic service providers, such as phone companies and email providers, to supply the federal government with customer records without telling the customers. 
<li><b>Secret Renditions</b>: Since 9/11, the CIA has flying captured terrorist suspects from one country to another for detention and interrogation, a practice known as ‘rendition’. For several years, the rendition flights were secret, and denied by the CIA and the Bush Administration. In Nov. 2007, under mounting evidence about the use of European airfields for this purpose, the CIA and Bush Administration admitted the use of secret renditions, including the explicit involvement of several European governments. The ultimate destination of rendition flights is usually Guantanamo prison. The Bush Administration justifies the practice as necessary for the War on Terror. 
<li><b>Guantanamo</b>: Guantanamo Bay is a US enclave in Cuba, run by the US military (nicknamed ‘Gitmo’). Beginning in late 2001, the US military has used the base to hold prisoners captured in Afghanistan and Iraq. The prisoners are considered ‘enemy combatants’ and hence not subject to US law, and since they are outside the United States, their legal status has always been ambiguous. In early 2008, the first military   tribunals were held to determine these prisoners' status. 
<li><b>Waterboarding</b>: The US Constitution forbids torture, and the 2008 candidates argue about whether waterboarding constitutes torture, and whether torture is allowed in Guantanamo or other prisons outside the US. Waterboarding simulates drowning, and has been used since the Spanish Inquisition in the 15th century as a form of coercing prisoner testimony. The political controversy around waterboarding was the key topic of Attorney General Michael Mukasey's November 2007 confirmation hearings, which led to an official admission that the US had indeed used the method.

<ul><h3>Gay Rights</h3>
<!-- Sources: (www.buddybuddy.com)/ (www.hawaiilawyer.com) -->
<big><b><i>Family and Relationships</big></b></i> 
<li><b>Adoption:</b> 19 states allow gay and lesbian couples to adopt children in a complex and expensive two-step process, in which one parent first adopts and then the second can petition for joint rights. 
<li><b>Ceremonial Marriages:</b> Same Sex Marriages may be officiated by church officials, or anyone else, but ceremonial marriages in and of themselves involve no civil laws and carry no legal benefits or responsibilities.
<li><b>Domestic Partnership Registration:</b> is a means by which some cities allow opposite- and same-sex couples to go on public record as a non-married couple.  The major benefit is used to establish legal responsibility for debts after a relationship ends. 
<!-- Cities usually charge $35-73 to register-about the same as a legal marriage license.  -->
<li><b>Domestic Partnership Affidavit:</b> Many private employers and municipalities offer domestic partner benefits to their workers, 
based on signing a legal affidavit that defines an economic relationship.
<!-- These often depend on signing an affidavit - not a city registration -, which frequently defines the economic relationship between the employee and the employee's partner. These affidavits could be used in court against a partner after a relationship ended. Like registrations, their legal status is uncertain.-->
 
<br><br>
<big><b><i>Civil Unions</big></b></i> 
<!-- Source: Partners Task Force for Gay & Lesbian Couples(www.buddybuddy.com) -->
<li>In Dec. 1999, the Hawaii Supreme Court reversed a 1996 ruling, and defined marriage as between different sex couples.
<li>In April 2000, the Vermont House of Representatives gave final approval to same-sex marriages. Gays and lesbians may join in "civil unions," which are no expected to be recognized by other states and will not entitle the partners to federal benefits. The Vermont Supreme Court had ruled in December that gay and lesbian couples denied the right to marry were suffering from unconstitutional discrimination. 
<!-- Source: New York Times, April 26, 2000, p. A12 -->
<li>In June 2000, the Supreme Court let stand a New Jersey ruling that allowed the Boy Scouts to ban gay scoutmasters. <!-- Boston Globe, 6/29/2000, p. A1 -->
<li>In July 2000, Vermont began offering a separate form of marriage, conferring about 300 spousal rights to same sex couples. 
<!-- Civil Unions do not have any legal weight in the Federal sphere, which means, for instance, that they cannot be used to obtain social security benefits, nor be used to help a non-citizen partner apply for immigration. -->
<!-- While non-Vermonters may register their Union, it is highly unlikely that any other state will honor the new license, so it will only be valid in Vermont -->
<li>The Civil Union license is obtained from town clerks. There is a $20 fee. The Unions are "certified" either by justices of the peace, judge, or willing member of the clergy. Civil Union couples also have the right to dissolve their unions through a "dissolution" process in Family Court. 
 
<br><br>
<big><b><i>Civil Unions Benefits</big></b></i> 
<li><b>Definitions:</b> Use of State laws that confer benefits or rights to people based on their marital or family status, such as family landowner rights to hunt and fish, or definitions of family farmers. 
<!-- Abuse - Able to qualify for various abuse programs as spouses. -->
<!-- Custody, Family Leave  -->
<li><b>Adoption:</b> Entitled to all the protections and benefits available when adopting. Same-sex couples already are allowed to adopt, but laws would reflect that those couples would now be treated as spouses. 
<li><b>Compensation:</b> Use of victims' compensation and workers' compensation related to spouses. 
<li><b>Discrimination:</b> Use of laws prohibiting discrimination based on marital status. 
<li><b>Health Care:</b> Able to make medical decisions for incapacitated partner. Able to visit hospitals visitation and be notified of a partner's condition. 
<li><b>Insurance:</b> State employees are treated as spouses for insurance or continuing care contracts. 
<li><b>Lawsuits:</b> Able to sue for wrongful death, the emotional distress caused by a partner's death or injury, and loss of consortium caused by death or injury. 
<li><b>Property:</b> Entitled to joint title, transfer from one to the other on death, and property transfer tax benefits. 
<li><b>Probate:</b> Use probate law and procedures. 
<li><b>State Tax:</b> Treated as an economic unit. 
<li><b>Testimony:</b> Not be compelled to testify against one another. 
 
<br><br>
<big><b><i>Federal rights NOT Covered by Civil Unions</big></b></i> 
<li><b>Immigration Rights:</b> Cannot have a non-U.S. spouse become a full citizen. 
<li><b>Social Security:</b> Cannot collect benefits upon death of a spouse. 
<li><b>Federal Taxes:</b> Cannot file jointly as a married couple 
 
<br><br>
<big><b><i>Same-sex Marriage</big></b></i> 
<li><b>Goodridge v. Department of Public Health:</b> The Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled in  Nov. 2203 that cities must issue same-sex marriage licenses. The first such license was issues in Cambridge Massachusetts on May 17, 2004.
<li><b>1913 Law:</b> A Massachusetts law from 1913, targeting miscegeny or mixed-race marriage, required that residents of other states be legally marriageable in their home state, in order to qualify in Massachusetts. This law has prevented same-sex couples from elsewhere marrying in Massachusetts. In Feb. 2007, Rhode Island became the first state to accept same-sex marriage licenses from Massachusetts (despite that same-sex couples cannot marry in Rhode Island itself).
<li><b>California</b>'s Supreme Court enabled same-sex marriage in a ruling on May 15, 2008, overturning a statewide ban, citing a 1948 reversal of a ban on interracial marriages.
<li><b>Connecticut</b>'s Supreme Court enabled same-sex marriage in a ruling on Oct. 10, 2008, replacing CT's civil union law.
<li><b>DOMA:</b> Largely as a result of the Massachusetts law, 25 states banned same-sex marriage. The laws are known as 'Defense of Marriage Amendments'. Several 2004 ballot initiatives brought out enough voters to not only pass state DOMA laws, but to influence the Congressional and/or presidential election. The issue retains high interest in the 2008 presidential race. 
<li><b>Domestic Partnership:</b> 11 states have some sort of civil union or domestic partnership law for same-sex couples. 
<li>As of the 2008 election, 5 states -- ME, WA, OR, HI, and DC -- have domestic partnership laws.
<li>As of the 2008 election, 3 states -- VT, NH, and NJ -- have civil union laws.
<li>As of the 2008 election, 3 states -- MA, CA, and CT -- have same-sex marriage laws.

<br><br>
<big><b><i>Societal Issues</big></b></i> 
<!-- (Policy.com) -->
<li><b>Boy Scouts:</b> In June 2000, the Supreme Court ruled that the Boy Scouts of America can bar homosexuals from serving as troop leaders.
<li><b>Don't Ask, Don't Tell:</b> The Clinton administration in 1993 enacted a "don't ask, don't tell" policy. Under the existing rules, gays can be discharged from the military for homosexual contact and for stating their sexual orientation, but the military is not allowed to ask them their orientation.
