	The Houses of Congress is a game that simulates a congressional environment in which you must vote, trying to appease the voters and get relected, until the game ends. There are 24 randomly selected issues that you must vote on. It lasts for 12 years of game time. After 1 issue, 6 months pass by before the next. In the House of Representatives, elections are every 2 years. In the Senate, they are every 6 years.

	There are three keyboard shortcuts in this game:

	Q or ESCAPE - Quit Game
	A - Open About dailog

	The max score in the House of Representatives is 90. The max score in the Senate is also 90.
